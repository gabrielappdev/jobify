We encourage applications from all sorts of diverse backgrounds.\n\nAt Podsights, we look for ambition and curiosity. Want to start a company of your own one day? Yes, we want to talk.

We‚Äôre less worried about a resume (LinkedIn is fine), but more importantly, tell us about your ideal next role.\n\nBenefits\n\nOpportunity to build something meaningful from the ground up. We‚Äôre changing the way podcast ads are bought and sold.\nFast-paced and challenging work environment ideal for a life-long learner.\nCompetitive compensation and a 401K program.\nFully remote role with an annual WFH stipend.\nWe cover 100% of health benefits (medical, dental, and vision)!\n4 weeks of PTO each year.\nHoliday break before the New Year.\nA generous parental leave policy.\n\n\nHere at Podsights, we believe strongly that we benefit from diversity and encourage applicants from underrepresented backgrounds to apply.
